Kaggle Competition: Forecasting Wikipedia Page Traffic
------------------------------------------------------

Results of my exercise to apply [Facebook Prophet](https://facebookincubator.github.io/prophet/) to the data from the [Wikipedia Traffic Time Series Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/web-traffic-time-series-forecasting).

`Wikipedia Time Series.ipynb` contains my main analysis and results. My GitHub Page contains a [static version](https://marcotompitak.github.io/kaggle-wikipedia/). The different folders contain various analysis scripts run outside of the notebook. See the README files in the folders, and descriptions in the notebook.
